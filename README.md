### Featured Tasks

1. Pluralize
    * This feature requested the creation of a method that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

2. Flipping Coin
    * This feature requested to write a function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.

3. Command Line Clock
    * This feature requested to write a method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. The program should run until someone manually kills it with CTRL-C or presses the “stop” button in their IDE. Each time should only be printed once. Your program should detect when the seconds increase and only print something out when the timestamp changes.


## Arrays, Loops, Imports, ArrayLists (Lab02)

This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java

Created By: Dasha Burgos

Collaborated With: Matt (TA)

### Featured Task

1. Rolling Dice
  * This feature requested to write a method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls.

2. Contains Duplicates
  * This feature requested write a function that would return true or false depending on if the array had dupliates.
  
3. Calculating Averages
  * This feature requested to write a method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

4. Arrays of Array
  * This feature requested for an array of arrays to calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.
